"""Fuzz the credential report parser.

The parser's contract is that any input is either parsed or refused
with a ValueError-derived error naming what was wrong. That named
refusal is the expected path and is swallowed here; anything else that
escapes, an IndexError from a short row, a KeyError from a missing
column, a UnicodeError past the decoder, is a crash worth a fix.
