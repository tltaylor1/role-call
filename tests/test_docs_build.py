"""The documentation site is generated from the documents, never
written beside them.

The generator splits the README into pages and rewrites links so the
split cannot strand a reader: every anchor the README uses resolves
to the page that now holds its heading, images travel with the
pages, and links to other repository files point at GitHub. The page
count follows the README's section count, so a section added without
the site noticing is impossible.
