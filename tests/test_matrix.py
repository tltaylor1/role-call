"""The role matrix, enforced and complete.

Two properties. Drift: every registered route is either in the matrix
or explicitly public, so a new route cannot ship unguarded. Enforcement:
for every matrix row and every role, the live endpoint answers allow or
403 exactly as the matrix says, using real sessions, so a route that
forgot its dependency fails here.
