"""Assembling an identity's privilege picture, with attribution.

Every capability names where it came from, because "this account is
over-privileged" is an accusation and "this account can rewrite its own
policy, through the automation group's PowerUserAccess" is a finding
somebody can act on. Groups are privilege sources, never actors
(D-019), so a user's picture is its own policies plus the policies of
every group it belongs to, each source labeled.

The readings underneath state their limits; those limits ride along
into the findings here rather than being quietly dropped.
