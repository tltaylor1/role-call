"""Sign-in rate limiting, hand-rolled on purpose (see D-027).

Failures are counted per key over a sliding window; success clears the
username key so a legitimate user who finally types the right password
is not served a stale lockout. Only failures count, and there is no
account lockout: a lockout hands an attacker a denial of service
against any username they can spell.

State is in process memory. That is a stated limitation, not an
oversight: this application deploys as one process in version one, and
a restart clearing the counters is acceptable for a control whose job
is slowing online guessing, not surviving forensics.
