"""Review campaigns: the workflow that turns findings into decisions.

Three rules give this module its shape. The population is frozen at
creation: the scope resolves to items once, with each item carrying
the evidence as it stood, so the campaign reviews a stated population
rather than a moving one. The machine recommends and never decides: a
recommendation names its reasons and waits for a person, and there is
no operation anywhere that disposes more than one item, because a
certification records that someone looked at that identity (D-039).
And "insufficient evidence" is an honest first-class answer that names
what was missing, because the alternative is a reviewer forced to
certify what they could not see, which produces approvals nobody
meant.
