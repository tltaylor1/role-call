"""Structured logging with a field allowlist.

Log lines are JSON objects, and only fields named in the allowlist may
appear in them. The allowlist is the control that keeps secrets and raw
user input out of the logs: a field that is not on the list raises
immediately, at the call site, in every environment. Blocking is
deliberate; a warning would let the value through exactly when it
matters.

Growing the allowlist is a reviewed change to this file, which is the
point: adding a new logged field is a decision, not an accident.
