"""Reading what a policy document can actually do.

Judgment lives here, so the limits are stated first. This reads grants,
not effective permissions: explicit denies are noted but not evaluated
against the allows they narrow, conditions are noted but not
interpreted, and privilege reachable by assuming another role is not
computed at all (the chaining limitation, recorded as an accepted risk
and inherited from the prior art). The consequence is one-directional
and stated wherever a finding is shown: this reading can overstate a
grant that a deny or a condition narrows, and it understates any
privilege reached through a chain.

Detection is capability-shaped rather than name-shaped: a policy named
ReadOnly that can rewrite its own default version is admin, and a
policy named FullAdminLegacy that grants three read actions is not.
The escalation combinations are the published taxonomy credited in
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.
