"""The governance layer: owner, purpose, flag, and attestation.

Two rules give this module its shape. Records are superseded or
cleared, never edited, so the human history stands the way the machine
history does. And the owner is typed, with teams as the default the
interface encourages, because an individual owner is the orphan in
waiting: the person leaves, nothing in the provider changes, and the
identity keeps its keys with nobody accountable, which is the finding
class this tool opens with (D-038).

An assigned owner outranks the owner tag for governance, because it is
the deliberate human input this table exists to hold, while the tag is
an observation like every other imported field. A disagreement between
them is surfaced rather than resolved silently: it usually means the
tag is stale or the assignment was a guess, and both deserve a look.
