"""Credential findings: the risk vocabulary, derived, never stored.

Each rule reads the derived state and either stays silent or produces a
finding that explains itself with the numbers that triggered it. Tiers
are the triage order a human works in: critical means act now, warning
means review this cycle, notice means context. Every finding carries
its external anchor, the OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10 (2025)
identifier, so the vocabulary lines up with the published one
(COMPLIANCE.md's frameworks-to-features row).
