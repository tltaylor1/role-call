"""The derivation engine: state from history, at read, never stored.

Everything shown about an identity is computed here from its
observations, relative to the account's newest snapshot capture time,
never the wall clock, so a month-old import shows month-old staleness
honestly instead of aging by itself (D-006). The two import sources
carry different fields, so the merged view takes each field from the
newest observation that actually carries it.
