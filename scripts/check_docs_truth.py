"""The docs-truth gate (D-031, narrowed at the program split).

The phase-status machinery moved to the program repository with the
journey diagram; what remains here is the ban on the specific stale
claims that once sat in public documents for weeks. Scoped to the
status-bearing documents on purpose, so history-keeping files can
still quote them.

Run from the repository root; exits nonzero with the rule that failed.
