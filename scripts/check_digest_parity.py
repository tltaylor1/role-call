"""The digest-parity gate.

Two invariants live in comments and nowhere else: the pipeline tests in
the same Python image the Dockerfile ships, and against the same
PostgreSQL digest the compose file runs. Automated update tools cannot
see the workflow-embedded copies, so a hand bump that touches one file
and misses its twin lands silently. This check makes the comments a
mechanism: extract each digest from both homes and fail on mismatch.
