"""The scoring page, generated from a snapshot of every outside rater.

    python3 scripts/render_scoring.py --fetch   # re-read the raters into the snapshot, then render
    python3 scripts/render_scoring.py           # render SCORING.md from scoring/snapshot.json
    python3 scripts/render_scoring.py --check   # fail unless the page is what the snapshot renders

Five services rate this repository, and each measures something
different. The page lists every item each one scores, what it saw,
and where the gaps are, so a badge at the top of the README reads
down to the line that earned it. The page never states a figure the
snapshot does not hold: the render is deterministic, the check mode
holds the committed page to the committed snapshot, and only the
fetch touches the network, so every date on the page is a date
something was actually read.
