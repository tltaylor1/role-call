"""Capture the README walkthrough screenshots from a running instance.

The images in docs/screenshots/ are reproducible, not asserted: bring
up a fresh stack with its own generated environment, import the
curated sample account oldest first, create one campaign so the page
shows a live review, then run this script. It needs Playwright, which
is deliberately not in the pinned trees; install it ad hoc in a
scratch environment (pip install playwright; playwright install
chromium). Credentials arrive as arguments and are never written here.

Usage:
