"""The mutation check (D-041): break a control, watch the suite notice.

Each mutation below removes one security control the way a refactor
accident would, then runs the tests that claim to prove that control.
A mutation the tests survive is a control whose proof is a claim, and
the check fails naming it. The mutation set is fixed and reviewed
rather than generated, so the kill list is readable in one screen and
runs in minutes, not hours; what it trades away is discovery of
untargeted gaps, which the coverage floor bounds from the other side.

Run from the repository root on a clean tree; every file is restored
whether or not the run succeeds.
