"""The privilege split D-013 promised (honored at D-051).

Run as the owner role after migrations, this creates or updates the
runtime role and grants it data rights only: read and write rows,
never schema. The application never deletes rows by design, so the
runtime role cannot: clears and revocations are updates, and the
append-only tables stay append-only against the application's own
credential. Idempotent on purpose; runs at every migrate step.

Environment: ROLECALL_OWNER_DATABASE_URL (the migrating owner),
ROLECALL_APP_DB_PASSWORD (the runtime role's password, set or synced).
